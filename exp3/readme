till now i have create a function merge which merges two chunks / "indexes" for given inverted table

need to create a bigger index table.... nerge recursively on it (pairwise chunk merging) and wrriting to disk 

say after a complete iteration output.json should be = outPutDisk.json

also need to add the index table json outputjson etc to gitignore
