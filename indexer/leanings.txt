for task 1, need to build an inverted index for boolean queries

an inverted index is term -> docID (via sorted(not necessary) linked list)
(will construct a sorted docID list using some external library)

should be termID -> docID, add to list using from sortedcontainers import SortedSet

so essentially a hashMap (term id as key) and value would contain the sorted set

parse query 
a and (b or c)

take in  a query, convert it to lowercase if it has x "and" b
do: for elements in inverted_index[x]: find unka intersection
