This directory contains all the models to implement the spellin correction. 
The HybridModel.py, Soundex.py, Ngram.py and Levenshtein_Distance.py files can be run to check spelling correction for any query of our choice.
The corresponding eval files have been created to check the accuracy of each model over the spell_queries.json file which was provided.
