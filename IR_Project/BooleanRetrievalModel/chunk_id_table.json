The size\nof DRC may depend on the number of faculty members in the Department. One of the\nmembers acts as its Convener. The term of DRC members is of two years. DRC is\napproved by the Director of the Campus on the recommendation of HOD through Dean\nAGSRD and helps AGSRD in operations from admission to final thesis submission of a\nPh. D. Candidate.\n2.2 Admission of on-campus candidates\nDRC plays an important role in admission of the Ph. D. candidate. Admissions\nDivision sends a link for list and details of candidates applied to all HOD\u2019s. HOD, in\nconsultation with DRC members, adopts a suitable criteria and accordingly shortlists the\ncandidates to be called for test/interview. Based on HOD recommendation, final list is\ncompiled by Associate Dean, AGSRD. The applications of shortlisted candidates will be\nhanded over to the DRC for further review. The examination paper (wherever needed)\nwill be made by the DRC in consultation with other campuses, thus, the same\nexamination paper will be used by all campuses for a particular discipline.

There is a scope of research work for the\nselection of critical and sensitive parameter and finding the interdependence of these for\noptimizing the combination of it. This innovative concept differentiates it from previous\nresearch work. It will be verified by conducting appropriate experiments on the electroplating\nset up with us. Further, it can also be suggested that it is very difficult and not practical to\ndevelop a pure robust system which is unaffected by the environmental factor like human error,\natmospheric condition etc. Applying some subjective guiding rules significant improvement in\nthe performance of system in the early learning stage can be found out.

Sexually transmitted C. trachomatis infection is an important public health\nconcern because of its adverse effects on reproduction [1]. In India alone a high chlamydial\nprevalence rate (28%) was found in symptomatic patients [2]. In women, infection with C.\ntrachomatis causes pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and has long term consequences \u2013 such as\ninfertility, ectopic pregnancy and chronic pelvic pain- that are secondary to scarring of the\nfallopian tubes (caused by salpingitis) and ovaries. In addition, infection with C. trachomatis\nfelicitates the transmission of HIV [3] and might be a co factor in human papilloma virus (HPV)-\ninduced cervical neoplasia [4-5]. The pathological mechanism by which C. trachomatis induces\nscarring is not well understood. In all cases the pathology seems to be related to a chronic\ninflammation caused by a persistent chlamydial infection or by repeated infections with the\nbacterium.\nLiterature Review: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nGap in Existing research\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nMethodology\nFor carrying out the proposed research work facilities such as tissue culture room equipped with\nbio safety hood and incubator, thermocyclers for Polymerase Chain reaction, cell sorter, flow\n22\ncytometer, confocal microscope and computers for analysis and storage of data are required\nwhich are available at the Institute of Pathology.\nPhase 1:\nThis",
