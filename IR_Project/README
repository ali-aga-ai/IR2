POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENT: 
THE CORE THING WE WANNA DO IS TO CREATE BETTER BULLET POINT CHUNKING AND ENSURE THAT CHUNKING IS DONE IN A WAY THAT TABLES  AND BULLET POINTS ARENT SPLIT  BETWEEN CHUNKS
You can prevent splitting by pre-processing your text to mark bullet lists and tables with unique delimiters, then adding those markers as top-priority separators. This way, when the text splitter runs, it treats those marked sections as indivisible chunks.
